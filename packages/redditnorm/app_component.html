<h1>Equal Repredditation.</h1>
<p>You've probably noticed how the <strong>top</strong> tab on active subreddits is heavily skewed towards recent posts due to reddit's exponential growth.
<br>Hardly any of the "top posts of all time" are even a year old.
<p>This tool displays the best content from a subreddit's entire history by dividing it into intervals and getting a few top posts from each one.</p>
<p>The most interesting subreds to try are the ones that have been around since the beginning, or have undergone a noticeable shift in audience. <br>
    e.g. <span *ngFor="let subred of ['minecraft','askreddit', 'pics', 'wow','hearthstone', 'programming', 'treecomics', 'fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu']; let isLast=last"> <a href="javascript:;" (click)="app.setAndStart(subred)">r/{{subred}}</a>{{isLast ? '' : ', '}}</span></p>
<small>Queries for cold ancient data might take a few attempts to go through, but we'll keep automatically retrying.</small>
